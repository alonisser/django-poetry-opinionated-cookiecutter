# Coding standards
## general
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., is_active, has_permission).
- Refrain from using generic "helpers" and "utils" naming unless something is really not application/business logic related at all
- Refrain from using "magic numbers" in your code, always name constants

## Python specific
- When writing python adhere to python standards including pep8
- Never return anonymous tuples as return type, prefer dataclasses or named tuples
- Use type hints for all function/method signatures. arguments/parameter type and return type
- Add docstrings to methods/files/classes explaining main functionality
- Use Application logic custom Exception classes instead of generic raise 
- Use lowercase with underscores for directories and files 
- Prefer "string enum like" classes reference over plain "string" configuration repeated over the code
- For constants not in enum classes, use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE naming convention
- Check changed files with `ruff check .` and fix accordingly
