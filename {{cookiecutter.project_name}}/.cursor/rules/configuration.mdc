# Configuration/Settings

## General Principles
- All configuration belongs under settings.py don't spray them all over the code
- use django-configurations specific syntax with Value classes when adding configuration

## Secret Management
- Never commit secrets to version control
- Use appropriate secret management services
- Document secret requirements

## Configuration Structure
- Group related settings together
- Use hierarchical configuration when appropriate
- Include default values for all optional settings
